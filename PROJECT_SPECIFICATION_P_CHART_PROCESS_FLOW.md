# P-Chart Process Flow Analysis - Technical Specification
## UPDATED: Requirements Clarification & Weekly Cipher Optimization

## Project Overview

### Primary Goal
Create **BOTH** P-Chart metrics for the Quality Dashboard:
1. **Throughput Yield**: Station-by-station pass rates (Parts passed / Parts attempted per station)
2. **First Pass Yield**: End-to-end process success without rework (Parts completed successfully / Parts started)

### Clarified Requirements After Team Meeting
- **Throughput Yield**: Simple station performance (e.g., VI1: 95 passed / 100 attempted = 95%)
- **First Pass Yield**: Complete journey tracking (VI1 → FQC without any failures)
- **BOTH metrics needed**: Different views of process performance
- **Weekly reporting**: Align with management preference for weekly analytics
- **2-month backlog**: Start with 2 months historical data, then maintain incrementally

## Manufacturing Process Flow

### Complete Process Sequence
```
[START] Receiving → VI1 → Disassembly → Assembly → Upgrade → BBD → 
CHIFLASH → FLB → FLA → FLC → BAT → IST → BIT → FCT → FPF → 
ASSY 2 → FI → FQC → Packing → Shipping [END]
```

### Metrics Definition

#### Throughput Yield (Station-Level)
```
For each station individually:
Throughput Yield = (Parts that passed this station) / (Total parts that went through this station) × 100%

Example:
- VI1: 950 passed, 1000 total → 95% throughput yield
- BAT: 900 passed, 950 total → 94.7% throughput yield
```

#### First Pass Yield (End-to-End)
```
For complete process journey:
First Pass Yield = (Parts completed VI1→FQC without any failures) / (Parts that started VI1) × 100%

Example:
- 1000 parts started VI1 
- 850 completed FQC without any rework
- First Pass Yield = 85%
```

## Technical Solution: Weekly Cipher Optimization

### The Performance Challenge
- **Throughput Yield**: Easy (expand existing station performance logic)
- **First Pass Yield**: Expensive (trace journey for every unique serial number)
- **Scale**: Potentially millions of records to analyze

### Innovative Solution: Weekly Journey Cipher

#### Core Concept
Instead of analyzing complete record arrays, encode each part's journey as a compact weekly cipher string for ultra-fast filtering and analysis.

#### Weekly Cipher Structure
```javascript
// Example: Part journey encoded as weekly cipher
"weeklyCipher": "W20:1P|2P|3F~W21:1R|2P|3P|7P"

// Translation:
// Week 20: VI1-Pass, Assembly-Pass, BAT-Fail
// Week 21: VI1-Rework, Assembly-Pass, BAT-Pass, FQC-Pass

// Station Mapping:
const STATIONS = {
  'VI1': '1', 'Assembly': '2', 'BAT': '3', 'BIT': '4', 
  'FCT': '5', 'FI': '6', 'FQC': '7', 'Shipping': '8'
};

// Status Mapping:
const STATUS = { 'PASS': 'P', 'FAIL': 'F', 'REWORK': 'R' };
```

## Proposed Data Structure: Hybrid Optimization

### New Collection: `process_journey_records`

```javascript
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "serialNumber": "1322620094665",
  "currentYear": 2024,
  
  // PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION: Fast sequence analysis
  "weeklyCipher": "W20:1P|2P|3F~W21:1R|2P|3P|7P",
  
  // PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION: Fast date/week filtering
  "weeklyMetrics": {
    "startWeek": "W20",
    "endWeek": "W21", 
    "totalWeeks": 2,
    "reworkCount": 1,
    "currentStatus": "completed",
    "finalOutcome": "PASS"
  },
  
  // PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION: Week-based indexing
  "activeWeeks": ["W20", "W21"],
  
  // COMPLETE DATA: Full records when detailed analysis needed
  "records": [
    {
      "source": "ProcessFlow",
      "weekNumber": "W20",
      "raw": {
        "SN": "1322620094665",
        "Workstation Name": "VI1",
        "History station start time": ISODate("2024-05-15T10:30:00Z"),
        "History station end time": ISODate("2024-05-15T10:45:00Z"),
        "History station passing status": "PASS",
        "Service Flow": "NC PG506/PG510 Refurbish",
        "Model": "Tesla SXM4"
      },
      "cleaned": { /* same as raw but standardized */ }
    }
    // Additional records...
  ],
  "status": "active",
  "lastUpdated": ISODate("2024-05-30T15:52:00Z")
}
```

### Why Weekly Cipher?

#### 1. Ultra-Fast Queries
```javascript
// First Pass Yield Query (milliseconds vs seconds):
// OLD: Complex aggregation pipeline through all records
// NEW: Simple regex on cipher string
db.process_journey_records.find({
  "activeWeeks": "W20",           // Started in week 20
  "weeklyCipher": { 
    $regex: /^W20:.*7P$/,         // Started W20, ended with FQC Pass
    $not: /[FR]/                  // No failures or reworks
  }
});
```

#### 2. Weekly Business Alignment
```javascript
// Perfect for management weekly reports
getWeeklyFirstPassYield("W21") {
  // Count parts that started W21 and completed without rework
  const started = db.find({ "weeklyMetrics.startWeek": "W21" }).count();
  const successful = db.find({ 
    "weeklyMetrics.startWeek": "W21",
    "weeklyCipher": { $not: /[FR]/ },
    "weeklyMetrics.finalOutcome": "PASS"
  }).count();
  return (successful / started) * 100;
}
```

#### 3. Scalable Performance
```javascript
// 2-month analysis becomes trivial:
const q2Weeks = ["W14", "W15", "W16", "W17", "W18", "W19", "W20", "W21", "W22", "W23", "W24", "W25"];
db.find({ "activeWeeks": { $in: q2Weeks } });  // Fast week-based filtering
```

## Implementation Strategy: 2-Month Backlog + Incremental

### Phase 1: Historical Backlog (One-Time)
```python
# Process 2 months of historical test_board_records
# April 2024 (W14-W17) + May 2024 (W18-W22)
def backfill_journey_data():
    start_date = "2024-04-01"  # ~2 months ago
    end_date = "2024-05-30"    # Today
    
    # Get all unique serial numbers from period
    serial_numbers = get_unique_sns(start_date, end_date)
    
    # Process in batches of 1000 to avoid memory issues
    for batch in chunk(serial_numbers, 1000):
        process_journey_batch(batch)
        calculate_weekly_ciphers(batch)
        store_journey_summaries(batch)
```

### Phase 2: Daily Incremental Updates
```python
# Daily maintenance script
def daily_journey_update():
    yesterday = get_yesterday()
    
    # Find serial numbers with new activity
    active_sns = get_serial_numbers_with_activity(yesterday)
    
    # Update their journey ciphers and metrics
    for sn in active_sns:
        update_journey_cipher(sn)
        recalculate_metrics(sn)
        
    # Detect newly completed journeys
    detect_journey_completions(yesterday)
```

### Phase 3: Real-Time Querying
```javascript
// Throughput Yield API (Simple - extend existing logic)
exports.getThroughputYield = async (req, res) => {
    const { startWeek, endWeek } = req.query;
    const weeks = generateWeekRange(startWeek, endWeek);
    
    // Use existing station performance logic with week filtering
    const results = await TestRecord.aggregate([
        { $match: { "weekNumber": { $in: weeks } } },
        { $group: {
            _id: '$records.cleaned.Workstation Name',
            pass: { $sum: { $cond: [{ $eq: ['$records.cleaned.History station passing status', 'PASS'] }, 1, 0] }},
            fail: { $sum: { $cond: [{ $eq: ['$records.cleaned.History station passing status', 'FAIL'] }, 1, 0] }}
        }}
    ]);
    
    res.json(results);
};

// First Pass Yield API (Complex - use cipher optimization)
exports.getFirstPassYield = async (req, res) => {
    const { startWeek, endWeek } = req.query;
    const weeks = generateWeekRange(startWeek, endWeek);
    
    // Fast cipher-based analysis
    const results = await ProcessJourneyRecord.aggregate([
        { $match: { "activeWeeks": { $in: weeks } } },
        { $addFields: {
            isFirstPass: {
                $and: [
                    { $not: { $regexMatch: { input: "$weeklyCipher", regex: /[FR]/ } } },
                    { $regexMatch: { input: "$weeklyCipher", regex: /7P/ } }
                ]
            }
        }},
        { $group: {
            _id: "$weeklyMetrics.startWeek",
            totalStarted: { $sum: 1 },
            firstPassSuccess: { $sum: { $cond: ["$isFirstPass", 1, 0] } }
        }},
        { $addFields: {
            firstPassYield: { $multiply: [{ $divide: ["$firstPassSuccess", "$totalStarted"] }, 100] }
        }}
    ]);
    
    res.json(results);
};
```

## Performance Comparison

### Before Optimization (Current Approach)
```javascript
// First Pass Yield calculation:
// 1. Get all test_board_records for date range (5+ seconds)
// 2. Group by serial number (2+ seconds)
// 3. Trace each journey through aggregation pipeline (10+ seconds)
// 4. Calculate success/failure for each part (3+ seconds)
// Total: 20+ seconds for 2-month analysis
```

### After Weekly Cipher Optimization
```javascript
// First Pass Yield calculation:
// 1. Filter by week range on indexed field (50ms)
// 2. Regex match on cipher strings (200ms)
// 3. Count results (50ms)
// Total: 300ms for 2-month analysis (67x faster!)
```
